# Access Data
Will be providing archival files here soon.

## Data Formats
Archival data in many formats will be available here.

### CSV format:
  * General use â€“ 2 or 3 really big files
  * Database use - many files representing tables, which can be
    used to reconstruct a databse of your design and choosing

### JSON format:
  * Captures more data, but harder to work with

### Postgres Binary:
  * Load into a postgres database directly and you'll be up an running in
    a matter of minutes.

## Troubleshooting
Will add to this later.
